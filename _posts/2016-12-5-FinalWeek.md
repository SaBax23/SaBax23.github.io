### Lectures
The lectures from this class were great. I liked the student engagement (voluntarily or not) and that we had opportunities to write code with our neighbors or together as a class, rather than just watching the professor from the sidelines. I also liked Professor Downing's cold-calling method, although it seemed like I was called on much less than some other students in the class (I assume this was unintentional). One thing I felt that I could have benefitted from was having well-defined topics or concepts for each day or section of the course. I found that I sometimes had trouble figuring out what key ideas or concepts I was supposed to be focusing on from the lecture, especially on days when we spent most of the class writing code. 

### Exams
I liked the style of the exams in this class a lot, however in a lot of respects the exams were frustrating. I really hated take the exams on Canvas and I feel like I had to spend way too much time messing around with the text editor and losing time that I needed to take the test. I also felt very pressed for time on both exams and on both of them I was not able to make a good attempt on all of the questions. This was at least partly due to messing around with the Canvas text editor, though, so I can't say whether or not the lenght of the test itself was an issue. I also felt that having a better idea of the type of questions to expect on the exams would have been helpful. After the first test I was a little frustrated because I had gotten the impression that there would be a lot of quiz-style questions and questions about the concepts. I felt that I had been misled about what to study and that I was not as prepared for the exam as I should have been. I think it would be more fair to give students an idea of what to expect, especially if there are only going to be two exams. To be clear, though, I thought the exams themselves were very fair and well-written.
