### What did you do this past week?
My group turned in phase 1 of the idb project and met to start discussing phase 2. We updated the layout of our website to look a little nicer and began implementing the API and database, but most of the work for this phase will probably be done next week. I also spent the week studying for our first exam.

### What's in your way?
A concussion. Oops. I spent a lot of time this weekend sleeping instead of studying, per doctor's orders. Luckily I've been pretty comfortable with the material so far and I spent a good amount of time studying during the week last week, so I think I'll do well on the exam. 

### What will you do next week?
Take the first exam on Monday. After that, I'll be meeting with my idb group a lot to get the second phase of the project done.

### Experience of the class
I learned some new mechanics of python this week, which was interesting. Specifically, we talked about iterators and generators and implemented them in class using yield. We also learned about the tokens *, **, and = and how they are used in a function call and in a parameter list. I've also been enjoying the idb project more now that I have become more familiar with bootstrap and the other tools we are using.
